There's a bug with the ogg files.
After trying to implement them for over 5 hours we realized that the ogg files were unable to be played correctly.
We even downloaded an mp3 file of the VampireKiller from the Wiki source (Khinsider - Vampire Killer Music downloads: https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/vampire-killer-msx2) and it also didn't work.
We used an mp3 converter and now it works (hence the test.mp3 and test1.mp3). Given that these are not .ogg files, we'll have to find new ones. For now, these will have to suffice.
