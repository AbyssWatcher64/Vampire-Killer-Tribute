## Vampire Killer - 悪魔城ドラキュラ - MSX Game Tribute

Vampire Killer is a platform game in which the player takes the role of Simon Belmont, a descendant of the Belmont clan, a family of vampire hunters. He ventures into Dracula's castle armed with a mystical whip inherited from his father, in order to slay the evil count.

This game has been done from scratch in C++ using the [Raylib library](https://www.raylib.com/) and ripping the sprites and music from the original game.

## About us:
We're a [@JulaChan](https://github.com/JulaChan) and [@AbyssWatcher64](https://github.com/AbyssWatcher64), a couple of students from [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/), located in Barcelona, Spain, who were tasked to recreate the MSX title Vampire Killer (悪魔城ドラキュラ or Akumajō Dracula in Japanese).

In January 2024, we took part in a GameJam and developed [Mend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) alongside other 3 collegues. Mend is a top-down RPG that takes place inside of the protagonist's dreams. If that sounds interesting, please do check it out over [here](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=jJVcTwbEOfZ_qXtw)!
