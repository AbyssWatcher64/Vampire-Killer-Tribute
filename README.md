# Vampire Killer - 悪魔城ドラキュラ - MSX2 Game Tribute

## Presentation
This project is a tribute to the game **Vampire Killer**, released by Konami in 1986. The team is composed by two students of CITM Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain).

This game has been done from scratch in C++ using the [Raylib library](https://www.raylib.com/) and ripping the sprites and music from the original game. It contains the first stage of Vampire Killer.

## Description
Vampire Killer is a platform game in which the player takes the role of Simon Belmont, a descendant of the Belmont clan, a family of vampire hunters. He ventures into Dracula's castle armed with a mystical whip inherited from his father, in order to slay the evil count.

Vampire Killer was developed and published by Konami in 1986 for the MSX2. It is a parallel version of the original Castlevania, which debuted a month earlier for the Famicom Disk System under the same Japanese title. However, the MSX2 version was localized first in Europe and was published without the Castlevania branding that the franchise would start using abroad in 1987 when the NES version was released in North America (where neither Vampire Killer nor the MSX2 platform were released).
