# Vampire Killer - 悪魔城ドラキュラ
Game developed by [@JulaChan](https://github.com/JulaChan) and [@AbyssWatcher64](https://github.com/AbyssWatcher64).
We're a couple of students from [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/), located in Barcelona, Spain, who were tasked to recreate the MSX title Vampire Killer (悪魔城ドラキュラ or Akumajō Dracula in Japanese).

This game has been done from scratch in C++ using the [Raylib library](https://www.raylib.com/) and ripping the sprites and music from the original game.
